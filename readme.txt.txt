Folders are as follows:

Setup is the setup program. You should use this if you only need to use the application

Shape2KML Readme contains an index.html file that you should start in your browser to see tips on installing and using the application

Shape2KML is the main C# Solution Folder. This one contains the code for the application, and the needed dll's. 
Check the bin/Release dir for the Google KML API dll's. 
You might have to reset the references to these dll's if you want to take a look at the code or make changes in the code.
